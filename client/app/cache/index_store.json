Kinematics of Machinery (KDM): Essential Concepts and Advanced Topics\r\nBasic Building Blocks\r\nUnderstanding the fundamentals of KDM is crucial as they form the foundation for the entire subject. Focus on the following key concepts:\r\n\r\nKinematic Links: These are the basic elements of a mechanism that transmit motion. Kinematic Pairs: These define the relative motion between two links and can be classified as lower pairs (with surface contact) or higher pairs (with point or line contact). Degree of Freedom (DOF): This determines the number of independent movements a mechanism can have. Mechanisms and Their Inversions: Study the various mechanisms, with special emphasis on the 4-bar and slider-crank mechanisms, as they are fundamental to many applications. Advanced Topics\r\nAfter mastering the basics, move on to these advanced topics:\r\n\r\nInstantaneous Center Method: This method is frequently examined, with at least one question in the midterm and possibly in the final exam. Velocity Diagram: Essential for midterm exams, and its prerequisite, the acceleration diagram, should also be understood. Acceleration Diagram: Less likely to appear in the midterm unless the paper is lengthy but is a key topic for the final exam. Cam Profile: Practice drawing different variations, such as Uniform Velocity, Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM), Uniform Acceleration and Retardation, and Cycloidal motion. Follower Displacement Diagram: This topic requires extensive practice as it is likely to be included in the final exam. Gears and Gear Trains: Focus on terminologies, gear ratios, types of gear trains, and numerical problems. One numerical question is typically included in the final exam. Static and Dynamic Force Analysis: The static part is easier, while the dynamic part is tougher and less likely to be included unless the instructor sets a hard paper. Prioritize static analysis and then attempt dynamic analysis. Balancing of Rotating and Reciprocating Masses: This is not very hard once the steps are understood. It involves a lot of equations but is ultimately a scoring topic. Notes and Practice\r\nWhile notes are provided, it is highly recommended not to rely solely on them. KDM is a subject that requires extensive practice. Solving questions independently and creating your own notes is essential. Practice the following to ensure success:\r\n\r\nTutorial Sheets and Assignments: Solve these thoroughly as questions on finding the Degree of Freedom and Instantaneous Center often come directly from these resources. By mastering these concepts and practicing extensively, you will be well-prepared for both the midterm and final exams in KDM. 7. **CSS Battle**: A web design competition. 8. **Design Rush**: A design competition. ### Aero Club: Aerodynamix\r\n1. **Guardian**: A challenge involving the design and construction of aerial vehicles. 2. **Game of Drones**: A drone flying and maneuvering competition. ● Gaming Event: Kreedomania\r\n1.

When the editorial team got together earlier this year, they were all bubbling with enthusiasm and ideas for this edition of the magazine. With this year's edition, we've tried to make the magazine feel more exclusive to the college by adding in new sections like \"Club Chronicles\", \"A Sentimental Stroll\" which we hope would induce a feeling of nostalgia and fuel the feelings of belonging to the college.This year's Srijan brings in a refreshed design with a more vibrant colour palette. As we have meticulously verified your entries and could not add all the entries to the magazine,due to certain constraints, do not be disheartened if your literary pieces could not be featured this year and let the literary\r\n\r\n flame burn steady within you, to fuel your preferred outlets of creativity. Lastly, I would like to acknowledge the untiring efforts of the editorial board. I also wish to thank our director Prof. Rama Shanker Verma for being the guiding light of this entire endeavour. I hope Srijan achieves greater heights in the days to come. -Dr. Jyotsna Sinha , Chief Editor\r\nCHIEF STUDENT EDITOR - To quote Sir Isaac Newton,\"an object will not change its motion unless a force acts on it\". Metaphorically, in this edition of SRIJAN, we have tried to constrain that force into reviving a monumental legacy of our coliege after a brief halt due to COVID-19. Of the many things I learnt being the Chief Student Editor for this issue, the one learning that was critical was about how easy it is to remain sceptical of any initiative or product from afar. It is only when you take matters into your own hands and delve deeper for an initiative, that you find out the diligent and zealous efforts of the people behind that initiative or product. Initially, there were qualms regarding the enthusiasm of the technically inclined crowd for a literary and artistic project like this and we questioned whether we would get sufficient articles and ideas to include in the magazine as we were starting from scratch after a considerable gap, which had slightly affected the adoration for the magazine among students. But l am proud to say that the students of MNNIT and the Editorial Team proved their prowess and came up with brilliant articles, short stories, poems, artworks and photographs on a wide array of topics. We have divided the magazine into three sections. They are English ;Hindi' and Fine Arts. The former two sections contain creative and well crafted literary pieces by the laureates of MNNIT On various topics. Fine Arts section is a concoction of beautifully captured photographs and elegantly crafted artworks by the artists of MNNIT. We believe in breaking the monotony of text with this issue of SRIJAN and have taken the liberty to club some entries of the Fine Arts section with the English and Hindi sections to make the magazine easier on the eyes. We have also included \"Professor's Panorama, a section dedicated solely to the Literary and Artistic pieces by the faculty of MNNIT, to give the readers a chance to know their professors beyond the walls of the class room. On behalf of the entire team, I would like to express my gratitude to the Honourable Director Prof. Rama Shanker Verma for the keen interest he has shown in the development of this magazine and the constant support and motivation he provided all along. I am extremely thankful to our Chief Editor, Dr. Jyotsna Sinha for being a constant source of guidance and encouragement throughout the prOcess. A special mention is due to all the contributors with whose briliance this magazine dazzles. Last, but not the least, I would like to thank all members of the Editorial Board of SRIJAN 2023, for their fantastic work, without whose untiring efforts, this project wouldn't have been possible.A big Thank You to the Section Heads for their selflessness and determination in meeting the dead lines and maintaining great quality of work, the Design Team for their attention to detail and dedi cated and sincere efforts in giving the magazine its current shape and form.Lastly, gratitude to all the final year members of TEAM SRIJAN 2023 for their contribution, for whom this project Would serve as a beautiful memnoir in the years to come. -lshanchal Kashyap ,Chief Student Editor\r\nFROM THE QUILL OF THE ENGLISH EDITOR -\r\nSonder, oh, a word, a word that has forever fascinated me since I stumbled upon it in the urban dictionary. The realisation that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as our own populated with their Own ambitions, friends, routines, worries, and inherited craziness - an epic story that continues invisibly around us like an anthill sprawling deep underground, with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that we'll never know existed, in which we might appear only once, as an extra sipping coffee in the background, as a blur of traffic passing on the highway, as a lighted window at dusk. To bring this concept to life, we are here with our annual magazine, SRIJAN edition 2023. Imagine a bustling city street, teeming with people from all walks of life. Amidst the hurried footsteps and the cacophony of voices, it is easy to overlook the profound depth off each person's existence. However, \"sonder\" urges us to pause, to look closer, and to contemplate the intricate lives unfolding all around us. \"Sonder\" invites us to step into the library of humanity, where every person represents a unique book waiting to be explored. As you flip through the pages of this magazine, you embark on a journey through the library of our college f the Community. Within these pages, you will encounter a glimpse into the depth and significance essayS, and inspiring accomplishments of Each Other at, captivating artwork, thought-provoking stories that shaped the humans of MNNIT. Our magazine stands as a mighty soapboX, a sanctuary for the unsung voices, and an oasis of diverse perspectives on life's mundane marvels - from the repetitive routines to the unnoticed sunsets and the fleeting moments that slip through our fingers like sand. This magazine is what that boudoir of fabrics is supposed to remind you of- that through silken deceit or women the same cloth. warmth, we are all but Cut It's not just ink on paper; it breathes with the essence of ideas. the untamed passions. We are stitched together in this vibrant fabric by Our innate ability to express ourselves, Our empathetic hearts, the audacity to dream, and a dash of innovation. As a team, we've braved the roller coaster ride of building this platform, a platform for voices and perspectives that inspire dialogue and introspection. We set out to amplify those quiet voices, to make them echo far and wide. For me, working at the backend was not just an opportunity, or an experience, but it was a way to flip through souls. A heartfelt shout-Out goes to our amazing Chief Editor, Jyotsana Mam, for her Constant guidance, and to our final year editors for their unwavering support and guidance at every twist and turn, and to all other unsung heroes on Our editorial team and the contributors, whose contributions have made this endeavour truly magical. Now, my dear readers, as you embark on this transcendent journey through the written symphony before you, allow your hearts to beat in synchrony with the vibrant stories that unfold. Let the raw emotions and poignant t us revel in the kaleidoscope of human emotions, for it is thrOugh\r\n\r\n dance acroSs your senses, for within these pages lies the power to inspire, to awaken dormant dreams, insights and to ignite the spark of change. Together, let us discover our shared humanity and embrace the endless possibilities that lie within Our grasp.

The CGPA is then computed by dividing the total weighted grade points by the total credits earned. ● The system of grading to be followed will be the Relative Grading System for all courses including project work. The HoD shall ensure that the course instructor/coordinator uses a normal distribution curve to award, ensuring that the majority of the students fall in the middle range of the grades. A student shall be awarded a letter grade in each course in which s/he is registered for, indicating her /his overall performance in that course. There are nine letter grades: A+, A, B+, B, C, D, F, N, and ABS. The correspondence between grades and points (on a 10-point scale) / rating is given below:\r\nLetter Grades and Grade Points\r\n● A+:10\r\n● A:9\r\n● B+:8\r\n● B:7\r\n● C:6\r\n● D:4\r\n● F/N/ABS: 0\r\n\r\n ● A student, who is not allowed to appear in the end-semester examination for any reason, such as shortage of attendance / disciplinary action / or alike, shall be awarded N grade. A student, who could not appear in the end semester Examination for reasons other than Shortage of Attendance/ Disciplinary Action/ or alike shall be awarded ABS grade.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"c75c9894-946d-4281-a2be-6b0ad466a259":{"id_":"c75c9894-946d-4281-a2be-6b0ad466a259","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"/Users/harsh/Projects/mnnit_gpt/client/app/data/draft.txt","metadata":{},"hash":"H/3aXHC28IRCc8iFTp0iVWbiwKE9TN84N2WduQZkO4Q="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"2bd89dc6-8a2a-4a16-a668-7fef0ac48154","metadata":{},"hash":"yugxJLxhcF98k2gumwib1p9KtiB+6QHCHcqLDM8Vsi4="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"3c69ff9e-6947-465c-acf1-4b71bf8ed02b","metadata":{},"hash":"C5rh3S7ImRktAnsqRHRKXI59EUQVoXUVvk0DXpw+350="}},"hash":"JiFv2mQ3qn3Ixz3gm1IzT1mLQYUJ51YgTqdp1zMvqoM=","text":"A student, who could not appear in the end semester Examination for reasons other than Shortage of Attendance/ Disciplinary Action/ or alike shall be awarded ABS grade.

What should I do if I lose my ID card one day before an exam at MNNIT? If you lose your ID card one day before an exam at MNNIT, here are the steps you can take:\r\n1. Use Your Aadhar Card as Identity:\r\n○ Bring your Aadhar card as a valid form of identification for the exam. It is widely accepted and can be used as an alternative proof of identity. 2. Report the Loss Immediately:\r\n\r\n ○ Go to the administration office or the office of your department and inform them about the lost ID card. ○ File a report if required. 3. Request a Temporary ID:\r\n○ Ask for a temporary ID card or a proof of identity document that you can use for the exam. ○ Provide any necessary documentation or information to expedite the process. 4. Contact Your Exam Supervisor:\r\n○ Inform your exam supervisor or the faculty in charge of your situation. ○ Show them any proof of identity you have, like a copy of your ID card, a letter from\r\nthe administration, or any other valid document. 5. Carry Alternate Identification:\r\n○ Besides your Aadhar card, bring any other form of identification you have, such as a driver's licence, passport, or any government-issued ID. If I need to go to the library, how can I enter without an ID card? ● Use an Alternate ID: Bring another form of identification, such as your Aadhar card, driver's\r\nlicence, or any other government-issued ID. ● Request a Temporary Pass: Go to the library reception or the administration office and explain your situation. Request a temporary pass or permission to enter the library without your ID card. ● Carry Proof of Identity: If you have a digital copy or any other proof of your ID card, show it to the library staff as proof of your identity. ● Contact Your Department: If necessary, get a letter or email from your department confirming your identity and your need to access the library. Attendance Requirements at MNNIT Allahabad:\r\n● The minimum attendance requirement at MNNIT Allahabad is typically 75% for all courses. Falling below this threshold may result in being debarred from the end-semester exams. ● Attendance is usually calculated on a per-course basis, with each course maintaining its own attendance record. The percentage is based on the number of classes attended out of the total conducted. ● If you fall short of the 75% attendance requirement, you might not be allowed to sit for the end-semester examinations for that course and may have to repeat the course. ● Exceptions or leniency for medical or personal emergencies are considered. Valid documentation, such as medical certificates, should be submitted to the academic office and professors as soon as possible. ● Some professors might offer extra classes or assignments to help students make up for lost attendance. It's best to check with the specific course instructor. ● Attendance records are often available on the college's online portal or through direct communication with professors. Regularly check your attendance status. ● There usually is a specified time frame within which medical certificates or documentation must be submitted. Submitting them as soon as possible is recommended. ● For long-term illness or the need for a leave of absence, inform the academic office and your course instructors promptly. Provide necessary medical documents and discuss possible special accommodations. ● Participation in official college sports and extracurricular activities may be considered for attendance relaxation. Obtain a formal letter or certificate from the organising committee and submit it to the academic office. ● Attending another section’s class to make up for missed classes depends on the professor's policy and the course structure. Seek permission first. Medical Leave:\r\n● Eligibility: Granted under serious/exceptional medical conditions, accidents, etc. ○ Must be endorsed by the institute medical officer, Govt. hospitals, or specialised\r\nhospitals. ○ Recommended by DUGC and approved by the Head of the Department. ● Duration: Maximum of 15 days per semester (cumulative). ● Extraordinary Situations: Decided case-by-case by DUGC. ● Longer Leave: Requires Semester Leave/Semester Drop with DUGC and SUGC approval.

Supplementary Exams at MNNIT Allahabad:\r\n● Supplementary exams are additional exams offered to students who fail to pass their regular end-semester exams, providing an opportunity to improve grades or pass the course. ● Students who fail one or more courses in their end-semester exams may be eligible for supplementary exams, subject to the institute's specific rules and regulations. ● Supplementary exams are usually conducted after the regular end-semester exams and before the start of the next semester. The exact dates are announced by the academic office. ● To apply for supplementary exams, fill out a supplementary exam application form available from the academic office or the college's online portal. Submit the form within the specified deadline along with any required fees. ● The fee for supplementary exams is Rs. 1500. Whether you have one supplementary exam or three, the fee is fixed and does not decrease. ● You can take only 3 supplementary exams in a year. ● Grades for supplementary exams are calculated in the same way as for end-semester exams. If you pass, the new grade will replace the original failing grade in your academic record. The\r\ntranscript may indicate that the course was passed via a supplementary exam. ● If you fail the supplementary exam, you may have to repeat the course in the next academic\r\nsession or as per the institute's guidelines. Continuous failure may affect your academic\r\nprogression. ● Supplementary exams are designed to assess the same knowledge and skills as regular\r\nexams, with the difficulty level intended to be comparable or lower to regular end-semester\r\nexams. ● Generally, reviewing your supplementary exam paper if dissatisfied with your grade is not\r\nallowed because the final result is declared a few days after the supplementary exam. However, you can talk to your professors if you want to review your paper. ● Supplementary exams are available for practical courses as well. ● There are no preparation classes available for supplementary exams. ● Stay updated about supplementary exam schedules and notifications by keeping an eye on\r\nofficial communications from the academic office, checking the college's online portal\r\nregularly, and staying in touch with your course instructors. ● You can give a supplementary exam for improvement with the same fee structure of Rs. 1500.
